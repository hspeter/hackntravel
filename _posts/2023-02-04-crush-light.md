Short-term rental apartments are great and all, but have you noticed how most simply don't have a bed side lamp?

We were shocked on how often this happened to us.

Sure, we could use our smartphones as torches, but that's just not the same if you just want to lay in bed and read a book, without needing to get out of bed to turn off the (most probably) cold and bright lights before falling asleep.

Entering, the crush light!

This light can be easily expanded to a proper standing lantern. Furthermore, it has three levels of intensity and if you hold the on button for a few seconds, the candlelight mode is activated and the lamp starts flickering nicely. Aside from that, the handle can be detached, so that it can be hung inside a tent or on any other place. Once used, the lamp can be crushed into its original flat shape. It can be charged either through the solar panels at the top or through USB.
