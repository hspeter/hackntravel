After living in Germany and Singapore, we had a colorful, chunky and bulky collection of plugs for our electronics. If you are not familiar with the German and Singaporean/UK plug, here is an example:

Adite also carried a, what we considered at that time, compact universal cube with multiple outlet options with us, on to of all these plugs. We are depended on a multi-socket solution, as it seems surprisingly common for AirBnB's to only have one outlet within reach of a table. And we both didn't feel like fighting over which computer or screen will get the privilidge of being charged.

As you can imagine, the plugs and cube shaped universal multi-socket were a true space hog in our travelbags.

Enter, the solution to our problems:

1. We decided to get rid of all German and UK plugs and bought new US-plugged cables for our entire electronic equipment.  
    Did you know (as a non US-citizen) that these US plugs are not only small but can usually be folded away? Yes, they can be folded completely flat to the surface of the electronic device! Here, see:

2. We said goodbye to our universal travel cube and hello to this wonderful piece of engineering: The xxx xxxx  
    It is super slim, can fit in the sockets of xx countries and has 3 outlets for US plugs. No more fighting over who gets to charge their device first!

The shift to US plugs and this multi-socket universal adapter has absolutely changed our travel game. We highly recommend this adapter to all traveling US plug users and advise strongly to all frequent travellers and other plug users to take the plunge and say goodbye to their bulky home-plugs.

It also has a fuse inside, so your electronics will not fry if the currents are fluctuating.
