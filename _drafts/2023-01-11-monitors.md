One thing, that might seem ridiculous and an unnecessary luxury as minimalistic digital nomads, are our external monitors.
We could live without, but we don't want to. 

I am currently using a 17" monitor, as I want to be able to see what I am drawing in CAD. My husband has a xxx" monitor, as this is enough for him to read and program his code.
