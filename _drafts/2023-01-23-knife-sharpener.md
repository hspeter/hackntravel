I admit it, I can't live without sharp knives around me.

But seriously, who wants to have squished tomatoes if you could also have thinly sliced ones?

After living in many short-term rented apartments, I started to get frustrated at the lack of sharp knives in each and every kitchen. I get it, it’s a rental. But still. Am I the only traveler that enjoys homecooked meals?
Simple solution, pack your own knife. That worked well while traveling with a car, but as soon as we decided to get back to air travel with hand luggage only, I started to panic. Will I need to buy a new sharp knife in every single place that we’ll be living in?

No said my husband and found the most amazing and very compact knife sharpener from XXX. I’ve been using it frequently since and am still so thankful for this tiny piece of kitchen peace.
