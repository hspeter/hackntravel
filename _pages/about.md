We are digital nomads that have been on the road since January 2021. We both work on a daily basis with two screens and love to cook. Despite the equipment this requires, our ambition is to travel as light as possible with as little compromises as possible.

We both have one carry-on sized backpack, <10kg each.

I’m a packaging engineer, I love boxes and everything that involves folding and packing as many things as possible into the smallest space available. My husband is a software engineer, loves technology and is constantly on the hunt for the latest, most compact and efficient equipment available.

Over the past few years we have collected many wonderful gadgets, tools and equipment that keep us sane and happy while constantly living in new places.

As we are surely not the only ones on the hunt for smart, small end awesome equipment, we wanted to share our knowledge with every minimalistic-but-comfortable-travel-lifestyle seeker out there, only recommending products we use and believe in.

We hope you’ll find what you are looking for and safe travels always <3

Santy & Henny
